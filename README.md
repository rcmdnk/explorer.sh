# shell-explorer
File explorer made with shell scriptã€‚

## Installation

On Mac, you can install scripts by [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew):

    $ brew tap rcmdnk/rcmdnkpac/shell-explorer

You can also use an install script on the web like:

    $ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/rcmdnk/shell-explorer/install/install.sh| sh

This will install scripts to `/usr/bin`
and you may be asked root password.

If you want to install other directory, do like:

    $ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/rcmdnk/shell-explorer/install/install.sh|  prefix=~/usr/local/ sh

Or, simply download the script and set where you like.

:warning: Install [sentaku](https://github.com/rcmdnk/sentaku), too
if you download directly.
